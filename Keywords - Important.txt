ECR(elastic container registry)->stores the container and provides for ECS and EKS.
ECS(Elastic Container Service)->manages simple to moderate applications,free according to aws.
EKS(Elastic Kubernets Service)->manages complex to large applications,high level scaling,experstise required,aws dashboard will charge,auto scaling.
CICD(Continuous integration and Continuous deployment)->---
1.AWS Code Commit->Like github repository,has masterbranch for deployment,possible to create other brances for employee,unit testing will be in sub branches or(other branches), Integration testing will be in min branch.
2.Aws Code Built->Testing tool,alternate to jenkins(testing tool),Build environment for testing,all successfull built,it creates a artifact or jar file,push the jar to S3.
3.AWS Code deploy-> deployment service,picks artifact from S3 and deploys  EC2/Lambda.On premises system/aws fargate,In place deployment(In existing system,downtime), blue-green deployment(0 down time,deploy in new instance).
4. AWS Code Pipleine-> Automate the trigger of code built and code deploy when master branch updated.
